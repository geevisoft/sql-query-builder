# SQL Query Builder

Just another SQL query builder focused on Java legacy projects. 
You will not have to modify any of your existing code to start using this when adding new functionality in your project.

## Getting Started

Load [SqlQueryBuilder.jar](SqlQueryBuilder.jar) as a library in your project

### Prerequisites

It's currently built on Java 8. Plans to get the Java API level as low as possible.

* Can avoid to edit any other file except the one where you "want" to add functionality
